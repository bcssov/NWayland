    /// <br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// The behaviour of a wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface
    /// depends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are
    /// synchronized and desynchronized, see methods
    /// wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized
    /// mode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's

    /// wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the
    /// synchronized mode.
    /// <br/>
    /// <br/>
    /// Sub-surfaces also have another kind of state, which is managed by
    /// wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This
    /// state includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent
    /// surface (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of
    /// the parent and its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and
    /// .place_below). This state is applied when the parent surface's
    /// wl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.
    /// As the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.
    /// <br/>
    /// <br/>

    /// <br/>
    /// Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as
    /// in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in
